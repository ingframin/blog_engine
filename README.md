# Blog Engine
A small blog engine written in python 3. It is based on CherryPy and SQLite
(The db engine can be easily changed). 

First run manage_db.py to generate the database.
In the setup method you can put your username and password and email. These credentials are used by the admin interface to add posts. 
This is a temporary solution, until I find time to write a proper db module.

I put my logos here but you can change it, feel free also to modify the HTML templates.
